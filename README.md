# Sorting Algorithms ðŸ”¢

A collection of commonly used sorting algorithms implemented in C and Java, with explanations and time complexity analysis. This repository is useful for students, developers, and anyone preparing for coding interviews or learning data structures and algorithms.

## ðŸ“š Contents

The following sorting algorithms are included:

| Algorithm         | Description                                         | Best Case      | Worst Case     | Space Complexity |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Bubble Sort       | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements                  | O(n)           | O(nÂ²)          | O(1)             |
| Selection Sort    | Selects smallest element and swaps with beginning   | O(nÂ²)          | O(nÂ²)          | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort    | Builds the sorted array one element at a time       | O(n)           | O(nÂ²)          | O(1)             |
| Merge Sort        | Divides array into halves and merges sorted halves  | O(n log n)     | O(n log n)     | O(n)             |
| Quick Sort        | Picks a pivot and partitions the array              | O(n log n)     | O(nÂ²)          | O(log n)         |
| Heap Sort         | Converts array into heap and sorts it               | O(n log n)     | O(n log n)     | O(1)             |
